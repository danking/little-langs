# Little Langs

This demonstrates three languages:

1. Integers and addition.
2. Integers, addition, and variable binding (aka "let").
3. Integers, addition, variable binding, and a syntax.

Exercises for the reader:

1. Can you add Multiply to lang2?
2. Can you add Multiply to lang3?

For the latter, make sure this evaluates to 25 not 70:

    5 + 2 * 10
